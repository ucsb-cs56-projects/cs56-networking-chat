### Chi X, SHengjia Y





a. This is an online chatroom program with basic with the usage of both server control and client actions including features such as logging in, displaying status and so on. It requires us to fix some bugs and enhance features.

b. 
- As an administrator, I can kick any online user in the chatting room.
- As a user, I can login and connect to server by using my username and passwords.
- As a user, I can see the contact list of people as online when they are online.
- As a user, I can chat with any one on my contact list.
- As an administrator, I can see who is online.
- As a user, I can hear sound effects for message received and contact's online and offline status.
- As a user, I can control whether I want to listen to sound effects or not.

c. We have tried current functions of the project. Most of main features are working properly. We can login by using the given combination of users and passwords. We can kick users from server. We also can chat with another person on my contact list. However, there are some bugs on current features. For example, we cannot send messages in the chat room. There are also a lot of new features can be implemented, such as sending emoji, pictures and user registration.

d. 
- As a user, I can register when it is my first time using the chat system.
- As a user, I can send emojis to better express what I mean.

e. I think that the current README.md is a pretty good sample of introducing the project to next generation. It provides all the descriptions of current working functions. However, I think that the reminders for improving features can be more detailed and abundant. They should be added more current problems, for example bugs waiting for fix and current features waiting for enhencement. I think that this is one aspect the README.me does not do well.

f. The build.xml is based on Ant. It is working well for current project. We may change or revise some parts of the file so that it appropriately runs our new features (such as the use of database).

g. Definitely, we can earn up to 1000 points by working on this project. They clearly explain what is wrong with current functions and what we need to enhance. Additionally, we also come up with good new ideas for adding new features, especially for database functions. We may discuss with our tutor later about this. Overall, the current issues are good enough for us to refer.
