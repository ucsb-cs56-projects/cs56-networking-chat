###issues and their estimated points###
1.Create Private Chat Room Feature

Add functionality to allow users to create private chat rooms, and to be able to invite other users on their friend list to join. The messages on the private chat room would not be broadcasted to all users, but instead only to the users in the chat room.  ---300 points

2.Fix Direct Messages

When sending messages to specific users, it is unclear that this is a direct message to the user. Make this clear through a "whisper" system, or some kind of color/text indication.  ---50 points

3.Add Text Color

Assign a random color to the text of a connected client and display their messages in that color. You may want to have a list of pre-determined readable colors to use.  ---150 points

4.Add Text font and size

Add two lists for users to choose their desired font and color for the text. It is only going to be a small list containing limited options.  ---200 points

5.Add Online User Count 
Add a counter to track the number of online users. This counter should appear on both the server and the client.  ---100 points
