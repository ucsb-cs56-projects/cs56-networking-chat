###XinYuan Z. Jared L.

(a) This project is a client-server based chat program.
---
(b) I can run Server.jar to start a chat server with the IP of the current machine. As a user, I can run the Client.jar file to start the client program that enters a chat room hosted at a server with IP:xx.xx.xx.xx which opens a single window interface. I can only login with credentials from a finite list of users currently registered with the server. I can type a chat message to a Broadcast user to send the message to every other user in the chat server, or I can select a single user to sent a private message to. All messages are displayed in a single window.
