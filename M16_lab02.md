a.This project is a chat room program that allows P2P (peer to peer) messaging, shows who is online, allows direct contact in between contacts that are online, includes sound effect for a message received, if contact logged on or off ( if sound effect box is checked), enforces login with correct password and Username

b.When the server is running, I, as a client, can log into the server so that I can chat with other people online. I can also receive a message from and send a message to other contacts when I am online. Also, as I receive a message, a sound will be played so that I know that I received a message.

...As a server, I can turn on the server for people to chat, shut down the server to terminate chatrooms, and kick clients/contacts out of the server. As a server, I can display the clients/contacts that are online so that I know how many clients/contacts are online and see occurances. As a server, I can display the broadcasts for all clients/contacts so that way everyone will get the message regardless if they're online or not.

c.The software does in fact run. The server has to run in order to let the client run. As the server runs, It allows users to sign in and chat with each others. It also is able to start server, stop server and kick clients off server. 

... As the client runs, the client is able to log in with the Username, password and IP address, the client can also chat with other (online) contacts in the private room, check or uncheck the sound box, and select contacts to contact list to send a messege

d.As a client, I can acces the settings bar to Implementing the font and color features I want. Also I am able to acces the Emoji bar to choose an Emoji to send. I am also able to create different private groups and add and delte any contact of my prefrence within that group I created. 

...As a Server, I allow new clients to register, and login and save their contact information(username, nickname, and password) so that they are able to log in later on. 

e.It would be nice if the README.md included a detailed usage of the application. Have that in a differnt directory, like a mini FAQ or Javadocs. In Features- "Server can kick users" feature is not very clear to what the feature does.

f.All targets have concise descriptions. No old legacy JWS needed to be removed.

g. Yes, there are enough issues to earn 1000 points and the issues' expectations are clear.

h. Here is a list of additional issues added 

 ...[emoji supprt](https://github.com/UCSB-CS56-Projects/cs56-networking-chat/issues/23)

i.Looking at the code, it seems that it is well organized with clear methods and what their purpose is. The class purpose is also clear which implies what methods are supposed to be implemented in there as well. Between classes, it makes sense that some methods need to call a method from another class and the classes interact with each other to formulate a comprehensive basic chat program. The code is easy to understand and readable. Quick summary of code, ClientController.java allows getting nickname, setting sound, checking if sound is on/off, server connection, sending messages, and updating contact list. RunClient.java basically runs the client window. Client.java is basically like ClientController.java with the addition of modifying username, modifying server IP address, and authorization of client on server. Contact.java basically shows modifications of contacts. ClientWindow.java is basically modifications to the window itself like font and font color. ServerController.java is basically a list of methods of what the server can control. RunServer.java brings up the window to run the server. Server.java is code for ServerController.java. User.java is methods for the client to modify anything about his/her account.

j. Test coverage is comprehensive. There are JUnit testings for ChatClient and ChatServer. The project is covered by everything except for sound test, private room test, sending message to offline contact, and kicking client off server (?). The exceptions to the test coverage could be the opportunities to expand test coverage. We can add the tests to the respective files.
